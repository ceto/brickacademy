              Hunor is graduating next year at Budapest University of Technology and Economics, so he
              is the youngest member of the team and was part of the second Brick Academy. Along his
              studies he participated in many architecture competitions and some of them was
              internationally prized/recognized. His main goal in architecture and making image as
              well is the importance of conceptional thoughts (inspired by films, books, other arts.)
              He likes sports: capoeira, folk dance, judo, free fight, squash; irrelevant fun fact:
              he was national 2nd place in chess at the age of 7.
